**Referenced by**: demo/healthhub/documents/readme.md

> **Purpose**: HealthHub domain delta for appointment workflows; extends the base SSoT and keeps only HealthHub-specific overrides.
> **📖 Authoritative Reference**: [Appointment Workflows](../../../../documents/domain/appointment_workflows.md)

## Deltas
- Base SSoT: [Appointment Workflows](../../../../documents/domain/appointment_workflows.md); apply all base lifecycle and transition rules.
- No additional deltas beyond using the HealthHub compose stack and service name (`healthhub`).
- Refer to the base document for canonical procedures; apply HealthHub-specific ports, credentials, and service names where applicable.
