## Deltas
- HealthHub follows the base guidance; no additional deltas beyond using the HealthHub compose stack and service name (`healthhub`).
- Domain modelling, architecture overview, and medication interaction handling all defer to the base architecture doc; apply HealthHub-specific ports, credentials, and service names where applicable.
