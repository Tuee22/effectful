# HealthHub Engineering Best Practices

**Status**: Reference only  
**Supersedes**: none  
**Referenced by**: demo/healthhub/documents/readme.md

> **Purpose**: HealthHub delta for Engineering Standards; mirrors the base engineering hub and lists only demo-specific overrides.
> **📖 Authoritative Reference**: [Effectful Engineering Standards](../../../../documents/engineering/README.md)

## Deltas
- Base SSoT: [Effectful Engineering Standards](../../../../documents/engineering/README.md); use the base doc for all canonical guidance.
- HealthHub-specific adjustments are limited to service naming (`healthhub`) and compose location (`demo/healthhub/docker/docker-compose.yml`). Add future engineering deltas in the matching overlay file (same filename as the base) instead of copying procedures.
