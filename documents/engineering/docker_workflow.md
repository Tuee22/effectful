# Docker Workflow (Alias)

**Status**: Redirect  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-03  

This page redirects to the authoritative Docker workflow standard:

- **Read**: [docker.md](docker.md) — SSoT for the Docker-only development contract, commands, and container architecture.

All references should be updated to point directly to `docker.md`. This alias exists to keep existing links working while documentation is consolidated.
